This repo tries to introduce django for web apps and follows from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oQvMHpKkms
first step is to install django, what requires a pipenv command, but it isn't still installed
pipenv works as a join of pip and virtualenv and aims to manage packages and dependencies, just as npm for node.js
pipenv istalled locally. More info @ https://medium.com/grupy-rn/gerenciando-suas-depend%C3%AAncias-e-ambientes-python-com-pipenv-9e5413513fa6
the command pipenv --python install django==2.2 isnt working, retries the former command omittng "--python" and it worked

27:00 urls are mapped into views, and urls.py manage their respective paths
so @ urls.py the paths refers to writing the adress to be acessed by browser, composing the desired urls.
At the same time @urls paths are defined, each of them indicate a name, wich is the view name, according to those described @views.py.
Those names @ views.py described in more details what html components will be present at the new pages, which are acessed by the respective urls.

--------------------------------------------
OBS: after a first exit from shell, when trying a new acess to it, the way I found to do it was repeating the former step, as done before, to get its acess:
pipenv shell, then
cd src, then
python manage.py runserver
--------------------------------------------
37:00 - important topic about how a template is set @django. Note that is avoided to simple use a path specification as \abc\def...
once it isnt os-safe (windows uses different bar orientation). So using BAR_DIR as is shown on video makes it safe
